Here's a breakdown of what we covered:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Daily Duties and Client Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, my daily duties involved managing client projects and ensuring timely completion. However, some projects remained unfinished due to clients' lack of seriousness. This issue arose despite our agreement of 50% payment upfront and 50% upon project completion. While the unfinished projects affect cash flow, the work on my end is often complete, leaving me in a challenging position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fixed Pricing Issues<\/strong>: Fixed-price contracts can lead to complications when clients request numerous changes mid-project. Currently, I find it difficult to refuse these changes, but this is something I plan to address within the next six months.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unclear Specifications<\/strong>: Sometimes, project specifications and benefits are not clearly communicated to the clients, which is my responsibility. This can lead to misunderstandings and dissatisfaction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Solutions:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>100% Upfront Payment<\/strong>: Moving forward, I plan to require 100% upfront payment. While this might hinder some sales, the psychological impact of the low prices might make clients more willing to comply.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Generous Refund Policy<\/strong>: If clients are unhappy with the project, I offer a 100% money-back guarantee, which we will discuss in more detail another time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Reviewing Program Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day in question, we reviewed the goals set within the mentoring program. We were behind on our goal of completing three \"Instant Web Solutions\" and optimizing my personal brand, gurbov.design, for sales by April 15th. These goals were crucial for several reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Site of the Year Contest<\/strong>: Completing the projects would allow us to enter them into the \"Site of the Year\" contest, generating traffic and visibility.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Testing the Business Model<\/strong>: It was essential to test the branding and business model to identify what works best.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Breaking Down Big Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant takeaway from our conversation was the importance of breaking down large goals into smaller, achievable tasks. This approach is key to maintaining motivation and ensuring progress. Each small accomplishment releases dopamine, keeping us motivated and focused.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Focus on Gurbov Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the brand \"Gurbov Design\" remains, my focus has shifted primarily to New Era. To be successful, we need to concentrate on one thing, push relentlessly, and avoid spreading ourselves too thin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our fourth conversation emphasized the importance of clear communication with clients, the necessity of upfront payments, and the benefits of breaking down big goals into smaller tasks. It also highlighted the need for flexibility in business models and the importance of focusing on one primary goal to achieve success. Moving forward, I'll continue to refine these strategies and focus on the growth of Digital New Era.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fourth Conversation with My Mentor Todor Madzharov: Key Takeaways In our fourth conversation, Todor and I delved into several crucial aspects of my business and mentoring journey.
