Progress Updates for Digital New Era<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>New Instant Web Solutions<\/strong>: Completed three new \"Instant Web Solutions.\"<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Designs Ready for Development<\/strong>: Prepared 3-5 new designs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Freelance Clients<\/strong>: Acquired two new freelance clients.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Positive Business Model Reconstruction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Changes Based on Interface Tests and Improved Functionalities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Setting New Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Progress Report<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After a dedicated week of work (minimum two hours daily), I completed the first \"Instant Web Solution.\" The design and dynamics are on point, though I might have gone a bit heavy on the onLoad effects. The design is flexible, allowing for easy brand color changes from one class, font changes with one button, and quick content updates on each page. It's streamlined and user-friendly\u2014simply perfect!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Business Model Adjustments<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing and Hosting<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the price was set at 150 BGN\/USD per month. Given our boutique digital agency's resource constraints, offering hosting isn't feasible for now. Therefore, we decided to sell the \"Instant Web Solutions\" as a one-time purchase for 599 BGN\/USD. We recommend Hostinger as a hosting partner and provide detailed setup instructions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simplifying the Model<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is currently too complex for our operations and clients, who prefer one-time payments. Post-purchase, we ensure the client receives tailored design changes, quality content creation (without relying on automation), and any additional changes or new pages are charged accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Interface Improvements<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The interface is clear and user-friendly. I might run a poll to gauge user feedback on the noise effect, which has received mixed reactions. Despite the feedback, I\u2019m pleased with it and the effort it took to optimize it without compromising site speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. New Goals<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I don't recall the specific goals set during our conversation, it's likely we discussed completing the remaining \"Instant Web Solutions.\" This remains a challenge due to the time-intensive nature of creating versatile, functional, and visually impressive themes. However, I have found a solution to streamline this process, which I'll share soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our fifth conversation underscored the importance of refining the business model to suit both our capabilities and client preferences. It also highlighted the need for continuous improvement and user feedback in developing our web solutions. Stay tuned for more updates on how we address these challenges and continue to evolve Digital New Era.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fifth Conversation with My Mentor Todor Madzharov: Key Highlights In our fifth meeting, held two weeks after our last conversation, Todor and I discussed the following points: 1.
