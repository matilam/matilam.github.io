Writing this text and this series seems pointless. Yet, I\u2019m relying on discipline over motivation. Todor and I discussed this a few weeks ago, acknowledging that there would be tough times where I wouldn\u2019t see the point and might want to quit. But my biggest fear is being \"average,\" and that drives me to keep going.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dreams, goals, and personal development are all about pushing my limits. I want to see how far I can go\u2014101% of my capacity\u2014so that before I die, I know I gave it my all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter II: Updates on Progress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Todor and I agreed that stepping out of one\u2019s comfort zone is essential for growth. Despite still being in my comfort zone, I\u2019m doing everything to get out of it. Creating Digital New Era on March 1, 2023, was an artificial motivation and a permanent way to stay out of my comfort zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, progress has been slow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The number of Ready Web Solutions has not grown.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I'm still unsure about their purpose.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I'm uncertain about the best payment, communication, and content acquisition models for clients.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus Dilemma<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Should I focus on cheap, off-the-shelf web solutions or more expensive, custom ones? More sophisticated and well-priced solutions seem more worthwhile. Explaining the best approach to a startup client for $600-$700 feels impractical compared to working with established businesses needing a new digital presence and willing to pay $3000-$4000. This allows for better communication and top-quality projects for both parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter III: Deep Reflections About Life and Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Balancing work and personal life is challenging, especially for ambitious individuals like me. However, I find it useful because some of my best ideas come unexpectedly. Obsession with ideas, ambitions, and dreams is beneficial. Working 8 to 5 is not enough and never will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter IV: Preparing Key Topics to Focus on<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What we decided to focus on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Marketing<\/strong>: My knowledge here is minimal, so I rely on strong empathy and good general taste.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Negotiation<\/strong>: I\u2019ve improved significantly but still have room for growth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business Expansion<\/strong>: Deciding when and how to expand Digital New Era and by how much.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter V: Final Conclusion on Where We Are and Where We Are Going<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, my goal was to work with startups and low-paying clients. Now, I realize the value in targeting higher-paying clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Visual Example:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend sold his old Citroen for 3500 BGN. He spent weeks dealing with potential buyers who wasted his time, eventually selling it for 2500 BGN just to get rid of it. Another friend sells luxury cars, primarily Audis from 2015 onwards, with no car under 20,000 BGN. He sells an average of four cars a month, with profits as high as 30%. The difference in approach and target market is clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on motivation, discipline, and dreams, coupled with the updates on progress, deep reflections about life, and preparing key topics to focus on, has helped clarify the path forward for Digital New Era. While there are challenges, the focus on higher-value clients and continuous improvement will drive the business toward success. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue this journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Episode Highlights: All this with the direct involvement of my mentor, Todor Madzharov.
