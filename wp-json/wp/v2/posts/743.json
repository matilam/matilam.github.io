Excited for this new learning journey!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Episode 10 with Todor Madzharov<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we'll cover:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pricing Strategy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A\/B Testing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monthly Subscription\/Pay for a Year with 20% Off<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customer Churn Rate<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Salary Negotiations in Person<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm writing this chapter in large segments, continuing it for the third time in three weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I: Pricing Strategy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting prices has always been a tricky balance\u2014low enough to attract business, high enough to reflect value. Recently, I've had an enlightening realization that I've discussed several times: \"repetition is the mother of knowledge.\" The most valuable resource in this dimension is time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of one's talent, if they don't value their time, they won't achieve long-term (or even short-term) success. I constantly battle with this, even losing clients because I've started raising my prices and valuing my labor more. Here are some fundamental truths:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I want to excel in the web industry.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I have 10-14 hours a day at most to work.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I want to eventually earn a significant income.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For me, \"significant income\" is at least 10,000 BGN\/month (bare minimum).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Breaking it down:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One client for 10k<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>One client for 7k and one for 3k<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two clients for 5k<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Three clients for 3.5k<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Four clients for 2.5k<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking more than four clients means I can't offer the best of my abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter II: A\/B Testing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A\/B testing, while seemingly straightforward, can be quite subjective. My mentor, Todor Madzharov, has guided me to these conclusions, and I appreciate his insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A\/B testing depends on its application. If the same people test two versions of a landing page on the same day, the results are likely to be 100% accurate. However, if we test live with completely different users from around the world at different times of the year, the accuracy drops to about 70-75%. This logic might not need much argument\u2014it's just how I see it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is, we should never take everything at face value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter III: Monthly Subscription\/Pay for a Year with 20% Off<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing a subscription model with the option to pay annually at a discount can help stabilize revenue. Here\u2019s the approach:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Monthly Subscription<\/strong>: Clients pay a set amount each month for ongoing services.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Annual Subscription<\/strong>: Clients can pay for a year upfront with a 20% discount, incentivizing long-term commitment and providing cash flow stability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter IV: Customer Churn Rate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding and managing customer churn is crucial. Keeping clients satisfied and minimizing the rate at which they leave can significantly impact the business. Strategies include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Regular Check-ins<\/strong>: Maintain communication with clients to address concerns and ensure satisfaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quality Service<\/strong>: Continuously provide high-quality service to meet or exceed client expectations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feedback Mechanisms<\/strong>: Implement systems for clients to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter V: Salary Negotiations in Person<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Negotiating salaries in person is a vital skill. Key points include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Preparation<\/strong>: Know your worth and the market rates.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Confidence<\/strong>: Approach negotiations with confidence and clarity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexibility<\/strong>: Be open to discussing various compensation packages, including benefits and bonuses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode highlights the importance of valuing time, the nuances of A\/B testing, implementing effective pricing strategies, managing customer churn, and mastering salary negotiations.
