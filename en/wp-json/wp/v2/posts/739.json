Unfortunately, there aren't many, but they are of higher quality and more solvent. With that in mind, we can move on to the next two chapters, as I hope to have this topic closed by the end of this season - \"Road to a New Era.\"<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapters II &amp; III: Latest Business Ideas and Preparing the First 6 Ready Solutions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I'll explain it like this (as I understand it and as it happens):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assume I am an accountant and need to register a new company for a client with a capacity of 5 units, accepting a fee of 1 unit for this service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, assume I register a new company for a client with a capacity of 100 units, but this time I charge an amount for the service - 20 units.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both clients, I go through the same procedure and lose roughly the same resources, but in the end, I extract more units from the more solvent client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I reached this conclusion for all digital services, not just the web. Ultimately, I still adhere to the one-man army model, and it will be good to have the limited time I have 100% utilized for as many units as possible. Expect even more premium solutions from me and Digital New Era.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, I will keep my model to myself (reusing all quality elements), simply not sharing it with the client because it doesn't affect them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter IV: Preparing for Pricing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that this chapter is also being covered here \u2013 pricing. Well, we're raising them. What can I tell you? If we're going to raise the level, we're going to raise the liability, and therefore the prices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This chapter is shaping up to be short, as are the other last ones, indicating my high level of engagement, which is good. By now, and maybe by the end of the series, something that has been cemented as a theory is that it's all about testing until a consensus is reached.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to Todor Madzharov, with whom I'm still having mentoring conversations. I'm just asking for them to be over a longer range so I can share results with him, not just my idle chatter, for which I thank him!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for the next episodes of \"Road to a New Era.\"<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Episode You Will See: Chapter I: Latest News for My Clients At this point, after more than six months, most of the \"debtors\" have settled their accounts, though there are new ones.
